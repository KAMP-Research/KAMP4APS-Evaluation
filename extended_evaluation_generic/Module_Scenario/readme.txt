Explanations to this example

In this example elements are added to the plant. This means there are two models: the original model and the model of the modified plant.
The algorithm does only work on one model (it is not comparing models). So it is startet on both models.
To get a meaningful analysis the added elements are used as seed modifications in the modified model (marked orange) and the original seed modifications are used in the original model.
The result is shown in column C. It is the sum of the results of the analysis on the original model (column A) and in the modified model (column B).
The results of the analysis without the "module rule" can be found in columns D, E and F.
